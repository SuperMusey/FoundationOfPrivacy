    "On August 22 the British landed on the shores of Gravesend Bay in southwest Kings County , across the Narrows from Staten Island and more than a dozen miles south from the established East River crossings to Manhattan . After five days of waiting , the British attacked American defenses on the Guan Heights . Unknown to the Americans , however , Howe had brought his main army around their rear , and attacked their flank soon after . The Americans panicked , resulting in twenty percent losses through casualties and captures , although a stand by 400 Maryland troops prevented a larger portion of the army from being lost . The remainder of the army retreated to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights . The British dug in for a siege but , on the night of August 29 – 30 , Washington evacuated the entire army to Manhattan without the loss of supplies or a single life . Washington and the Continental Army were driven out of New York entirely after several more defeats , and forced to retreat through New Jersey and into Pennsylvania .",

Consent for the enclosure of the parish of Weston @-@ sub @-@ Edge was given in 1850 , signalling the end of the Games in 1852 . The parish 's 969 acres ( 392 ha ) were divided among local farmers and landowners ; Reverend Bourne , who a few years earlier had complained so vociferously about the Games , received 63 acres ( 25 ha ) .",

    "Serotonin toxicity has a characteristic picture which is generally hard to confuse with other medical conditions , but in some situations it may go unrecognized because it may be mistaken for a viral illness , anxiety , neurological disorder , anticholinergic poisoning , sympathomimetic toxicity , or worsening psychiatric condition . The condition most often confused with serotonin syndrome is neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS ) . The clinical features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome share some features which can make differentiating them difficult . In both conditions , autonomic dysfunction and altered mental status develop . However , they are actually very different conditions with different underlying dysfunction ( serotonin excess vs dopamine blockade ) . Both the time course and the clinical features of NMS differ significantly from those of serotonin toxicity . Serotonin toxicity has a rapid onset after the administration of a serotonergic drug and responds to serotonin blockade such as drugs like chlorpromazine and cyproheptadine . Dopamine receptor blockade ( NMS ) has a slow onset and typically evolves over several days after administration of a neuroleptic drug and responds to dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine .",

Legend says that the screen was given to the Inn by Elizabeth I while she was the Inn 's patron , and is carved out of the wood of a Spanish galleon captured from the Spanish Armada . The Hall was lit with the aid of massive windows filled with the Coats of Arms of those members who became Treasurers . The Benchers ' table is also said to have been a gift from Elizabeth , and as a result the only public toast in the Inn until the late 19th century was \" to the glorious , pious and immortal memory of Queen Elizabeth \" .",

The site originally chosen , a field about a mile outside Tunbridge Wells was deemed unsuitable as there were obstacles surrounding it . It was decided to continue the pageant at Penshurst . Five civil de Havilland Moths and three Armstrong Whitworth Siskins from No. 56 Squadron RAF , based at nearby RAF Biggin Hill attended . The pageant was to promote the proposed Tunbridge Wells Flying Club , whose President was to be Sir Robert Gower . It was reported that part of Penshurst Airfield had been rented by the club .

The three drew inspiration from character designs done by Amano and the atmospheres of game locations . Matsuda and Itahana also respectively did the character designs for Bhunivelze and Lumina . Tetsuya Nomura returned to design Lightning and Snow 's new looks . Kamikokuryo used the game 's theme of a dying world to create Nova Chrysalia , as well as incorporating cultural and architectural influences from the Middle East , Asia , and London during the Industrial Revolution . Nova Chrysalia was originally conceived as a single island , but as the game 's development advanced , the world grew into its final , four @-@ island configuration . The world 's open design was inspired by MMORPGs such as Final Fantasy XI , described by Abe as a \" tourist guide style \" . Each island was designed to have a definite feel and theme , while their construction was handled by separate small teams , with the content for each area held and quality @-@ controlled by each team . The art team used multiple real world locations as inspiration : Luxerion and Yusnaan were inspired by Paris and Las Vegas , while the Dead Dunes and Wildlands were influenced by Cairo and Costa Rica . The scenery for the final FMV was based on southern Europe .",

The first title in the series is the Xbox version of Halo : Combat Evolved , released on November 15 , 2001 . The game was initially intended to be released for Windows and Mac OS , until Microsoft 's purchase of Bungie in 2000 led to the game becoming an Xbox launch title and platform exclusive . Halo : Combat Evolved introduced many gameplay and plot themes common to the whole trilogy . Players battle various aliens on foot and in vehicles to complete objectives , while attempting to uncover the secrets of the eponymous Halo . One concept introduced in Halo : Combat Evolved , is limiting the number of weapons players could carry to two , forcing them to carefully select their preferred armament . Players fight with ranged and melee attacks , as well as a limited number of grenades . Bungie refers to the \" weapons @-@ grenades @-@ melee \" format as the \" Golden Triangle of Halo \" , which has remained fundamentally unchanged throughout the trilogy . In Halo : Combat Evolved , the player 's health is measured in both hit points and a continually recharging energy shield ; the sequels forgo the hit point system , although it returns in spin @-@ offs .

    "The ectomycorrhizae of T. vaccinum has been the subject of considerable research . Ectomycorrhizae of Tricholoma species can vary considerably among species in the genus , and differences in the structure of rhizomorphs ( a cordlike fusions of hyphae resembling a root ) have been used to key out species . Mycorrhizae formed with Norway spruce ( Picea abies ) are conspicuously hairy with numerous hyphae . The hyphae are partly densely interconnected to rhizomorphs that have a pigment in their outer membrane . The emanating hyphae mostly lack \" contact septae \" ( fully developed simple septae ) and contact clamps , and the rhizomorph hyphae vary markedly in diameter . The Hartig net ( a network of hyphae that extend into the root ) formed by T. vaccinum grows more deeply towards the epidermis , is composed of more rows of hyphae and has more tannin cells in close proximity to the epidermis , and consequently , fewer cortical cells in this position . It is here that the rhizomorphs make the closest contact with the rootlets . The mantle is prosenchymatous , meaning that the constituent hyphae are loosely organized with spaces between them . A combination of techniques including freeze fracturing and scanning electron microscopy has been used to probe the microstructure of the ectomycorrhizae , including inner mantle thickness and the nature of the interface between the Hartig net and host cells . Several fungal genes specifically expressed during ectomycorrhizal interaction between T. vaccinum and Picea abies have been identified , including some involved in a plant pathogen response , nutrient exchange and growth in the plant , signal transduction , and stress response . The first characterized fungal aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme , ALD1 , helps circumvent ethanol stress — a critical function in mycorrhizal habitats .",

All told , five large canals that originated from the dams in the Jordan Narrows were completed by 1883 . A second dam was built in 1890 a few miles downstream from the first dam and was constructed to better regulate the flow of two canals . Both dams have been rebuilt in subsequent years and operate as diversion points for canals rather than impounding water by the use of sluice gates and head gates . The drought of 1901 – 1902 caused the Jordan River , on occasion , to stop flowing , and in response to the drought a pumping plant was installed at the outlet from Utah Lake . It was the largest pumping plant in the United States at the time , and contained seven pumps with a total capacity of 700 cubic feet ( 20 m3 ) per second . Twice , during the droughts of 1934 and 1992 , Utah Lake levels dropped so low that the pumps were rendered useless and the Jordan River actually ran dry .

Although a common genus , the dinosaur had been poorly known until more material of other individuals was discovered during expeditions led by American palaeontologist Paul Sereno in 1997 and 2000 . The limited understanding of the genus was the result of poor preservation of its remains , which arises from the delicate and highly pneumatic construction of the skull and skeleton , in turn causing disarticulation of the fossils . Some of the skull fossils were so thin that a strong light beam was visible through them . Therefore , no intact skulls or articulated skeletons have been found , and these specimens represent the most complete known rebbachisaurid remains .",

    "Hoffman is known for his high leg kick , the menacing glare through his cap pulled down almost to his eyes , and his deceptive changeup . When Hoffman first came into the league , he could throw up to 95 mph . He would also throw a slider and only an occasional changeup . His original changeup was a conventional circle changeup taught to him by Cincinnati scout Larry Barton . Hoffman learned a different changeup , which he throws with a palmball grip , from teammate Donnie Elliott in 1994 . He began using the new changeup in 1995 when his fastball had dropped to 88 – 90 mph after his offseason injury on the beach . With the decrease in velocity , Hoffman knew he could not rely as much on his fastball . He played through 1995 and had surgery the following offseason for a torn rotator cuff . When he returned the following year , Hoffman 's fastball was at 87 – 88 mph , but he had more experience with his new changeup . His fastball reached back as high as 91 mph in 1998 , but by sometime after 2000 it dropped down to 83 – 88 mph .

These rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future ; the time increment for this prediction is called a time step . This future atmospheric state is then used as the starting point for another application of the predictive equations to find new rates of change , and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time step into the future .

    "Most people who move across the border are women and girls . The migration of Haitian women to the Dominican Republic is intrinsically linked to the “ feminization of migrations ” which is in turn part of the “ new Haitian immigration , ” brought about by changes in labor markets as well as by the fragile situation of women and their families in Haiti . Women migrants are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking , violence and illicit smuggling . When attempting to cross the border , Haitian women are at risk of being robbed , assaulted , raped and murdered , at the hands of smugglers , delinquents and traffickers , both Dominican and Haitian . Given this threat of violence , women turn to alternative , unofficial routes and dependence upon hired buscones ( informal scouts ) , cousins and other distant family to accompany them across the border . These hired smugglers who have promised to help them , often through force and coercion , trick them instead into forced domestic labor in private homes in Santo Domingo , the capital of Dominican Republic . Hired buscones also sell women and children into the sex slave trade within the Dominican Republic ( brothels and other venues ) or into sexual slavery as an export . Often , mothers need their young children to help provide for the family , which puts the children in vulnerable positions and allows them to fall prey to predators and traffickers . The number of children smuggled into the Dominican Republic is not known , but a UNICEF estimate placed the number at 2 @,@ 000 in 2009 alone . Haitian officials report that there are three main fates met by children trafficked out of Haiti : domestic work , prostitution , and organ harvesting .",

    "The middle decades of the 20th century saw the rise of molecular biology , and with it an understanding of the chemical nature of genes as sequences of DNA and of their relationship — through the genetic code — to protein sequences . At the same time , increasingly powerful techniques for analyzing proteins , such as protein electrophoresis and sequencing , brought biochemical phenomena into realm of the synthetic theory of evolution . In the early 1960s , biochemists Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed the molecular clock hypothesis ( MCH ) : that sequence differences between homologous proteins could be used to calculate the time since two species diverged . By 1969 , Motoo Kimura and others provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock , arguing that — at the molecular level at least — most genetic mutations are neither harmful nor helpful and that mutation and genetic drift ( rather than natural selection ) cause a large portion of genetic change : the neutral theory of molecular evolution . Studies of protein differences within species also brought molecular data to bear on population genetics by providing estimates of the level of heterozygosity in natural populations .",

He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in , his glasses were molded into the frame of the car , but he survived completely uninjured . Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ . Lecrae went back to his college , the University of North Texas , with a printed version of his testimony to pass out on campus . He started volunteering and performing at a juvenile detention center , and the reception he received convinced him that offering \" hope and encouragement \" through music was what he wanted to do . However , Lecrae still struggled in his faith − as revealed in \" Good , Bad , Ugly \" , in 2002 he impregnated a then @-@ girlfriend .

    "After completing German Ideology , Marx turned to a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding \" the theory and tactics \" of a truly \" revolutionary proletarian movement \" operating from the standpoint of a truly \" scientific materialist \" philosophy . This work was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx 's own scientific socialist philosophy . Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded one person at a time to join the socialist movement , the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief , Marx knew that people would tend on most occasions to act in accordance with their own economic interests . Thus , appealing to an entire class ( the working class in this case ) with a broad appeal to the class 's best material interest would be the best way to mobilise the broad mass of that class to make a revolution and change society . This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning .

    "The Puget Sound Convergence Zone is an important feature of Seattle 's weather . In the convergence zone , air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south . Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean ; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle 's west , then reunited to the east . When the air currents meet , they are forced upward , resulting in convection . Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur north and south of town , but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers . The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to 69 mph ( 111 km / h ) , an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest .",

    "One definition sees language primarily as the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour : to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances . This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans , and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain . Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction . Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language ; for example , creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language . This view , which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes , understands language to be largely innate , for example , in Chomsky 's theory of Universal Grammar , or American philosopher Jerry Fodor 's extreme innatist theory . These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics .",

    "Because lionesses hunt in open spaces where they are easily seen by their prey , cooperative hunting increases the likelihood of a successful hunt ; this is especially true with larger species . Teamwork also enables them to defend their kills more easily against other large predators such as hyenas , which may be attracted by vultures from kilometres away in open savannas . Lionesses do most of the hunting ; males attached to prides do not usually participate in hunting , except in the case of larger quarry such as giraffe and buffalo . In typical hunts , each lioness has a favoured position in the group , either stalking prey on the \" wing \" then attacking , or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey in flight from other lionesses . There is evidence that male lions are just as successful at hunting as females ; they are solo hunters who ambush prey in small bush . Young lions first display stalking behaviour around three months of age , although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old . They begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two .",

    "Like many plants in south @-@ west Western Australia , B. attenuata is adapted to an environment in which bushfire events are relatively frequent . Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire : reseeders are killed by fire , but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank , thus promoting recruitment of the next generation ; resprouters survive fire , resprouting from a lignotuber or , more rarely , epicormic buds protected by thick bark . Bearing epicormic buds and a lignotuber , B. attenuata is one of the latter group , with follicles that may open spontaneously or by fire . It is moderately serotinous , storing only one tenth the number of seeds in its seed bank as the reseeding B. hookeriana which it coexists with on sand dunes in scrub at Eneabba north of Perth . Even then , many of its follicles do not release seed after a fire , but instead after successive autumn rains . An experiment simulating wet weather following a fire saw a series of Banksia attenuata cones with follicles subjected to twice weekly immersions in water after being heated in a ring Bunsen flame to around 500 – 600 ° C ( 932 – 1 @,@ 112 ° F ) for two minutes . Cones that had been exposed to water for more weeks had more seed released from follicles over time ; around 40 % released at three weeks , increasing steadily to almost 90 % at ten weeks , compared with a series of controls ( which were kept dry ) of which fewer than 10 % of seed released . Thus , the seed remains in the follicles until successive rains result in seed dispersal in the wetter winter ( instead of dryer summer ) , increasing the chance of survival . After the follicle is split , the seed and separator are exposed to the elements . The wings of the woody separator are hygroscopic , and move together when wet , and spread and curl apart when dry . The seed is gradually drawn out by the movement with each wetting . Once released , seed germinates at temperatures between 15 and 20 ° C ( 59 and 68 ° F ) to optimise timing with autumn and winter rains and hence maximise chance of survival . Still , many seedlings die off in the hot and dry summer months . Seedling survival for the species is lower than for banksias which regenerate by seeding over time . Despite this , the longevity of mature plants allows for maintenance of population until favourable years enable better survival of young plants . As they mature , plants are less likely to perish , and estimated to live for 300 years or more . Analyzing the seed bank and longitudinal results over fifteen years on the Eneabba sandplain showed that B. attenuata would become more abundant over time with fire intervals averaging between 6 and 20 years , peaking with intervals around 10 to 12 years , compared with longer intervals for the reseeders B. hookeriana and B. prionotes .

    "When the Second World War broke out , only limited resources where allotted to the defence of Northern Sweden , but following the Soviet attack on Finland a few months later and the German Operation Weserübung against Norway and Denmark the next year , major work on improving and extending the defensive lives was commenced . Bunkers , bomb shelters , gun emplacements — particularly for anti @-@ tank guns — were built by the units that had been mobilised and stationed in the vicinity of Boden . The Finnish experiences gained from meeting superior armoured forces during the Winter War were adopted in Sweden , and triple rows of large stones or blocks of reinforced concrete , dragon 's teeth , soon formed a continuous line — defended by anti @-@ tank guns in concrete bunkers and machine @-@ gun nests — around the fortress and city . As the war continued and advances in most fields of warfare were made , Boden Fortress was continually improved to meet new or increased threats such as air , armoured or gas attacks .
